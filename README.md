# Unity Create with Code: Enhanced Gameplay Solutions

This repository is a dedicated resource for students and educators involved in Unity's "Create with Code" course. It contains the solutions to the basic gameplay module, enriched with custom scripts to provide an in-depth understanding of game mechanics.

## What's Inside

- **Original Unity Course Solutions**: The core solutions provided by Unity, serving as the foundation for learning.
- **Custom Scripts**: Enhancements and additional scripts that build upon the basic solutions to demonstrate more advanced concepts and best practices.

### Featured Scripts
